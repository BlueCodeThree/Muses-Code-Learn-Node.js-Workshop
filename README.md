Workshop with Muses Code on Node.js,  where I created a website with Node.js and Express.

The website was a recipe website, with adding, editing and deleting recipes in an admin area

## Things I Learnt

* Creating a server
* Static Assets
* Creating Routes
* Templates
* Partials
* Adding a Recipe Page
* Adding a Recipe Database
* Adding Individual Recipe Pages
* Adding Admin Features
* Editing a Recipe

Things recommended to pursue further but were not covered in this course:

1. Authentication, for only specific people being able to access admin
2. Error checking.
