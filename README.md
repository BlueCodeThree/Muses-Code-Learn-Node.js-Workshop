# Muses-Code-Learn-Node.js-Workshop
Workshop with Muses Code on Node.js,  where I created a website with Node.js and Express.

The website was a simple recipe website, with adding, editing and deleting recipes in an admin area

## Things I Learnt

* How to set up a project
* Creating a server
* Static Assets
* Creating Routes
* Templates
* Partials
* Adding a Recipe Page
* Adding a Recipe Database
* Adding Individual Recipe Pages
* Adding Admin Features
* Editing a Recipe
* Working with Markdown
* Adding a New Recipe
* Deleting a Recipe

Things recommended to pursue further but were not covered in this course:

1. Authentication. If you deployed this app now on the internet, anyone would be able to just add, edit or delete recipes. Normally you would require some kind of authentication and only allow specific people access to the admin features.
2. Error checking. We didn’t check for any errors. Normally you would verify things. Like does this `recipe exist before we try to update it. Don’t assume that everything will go smoothly.
